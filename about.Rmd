## Applied Statistician
I am currently an MSc at Carleton University, co-supervised by Drs [Adam Smith](https://carleton.ca/biology/people/adam-smith/) and [Joe Bennett](https://carleton.ca/biology/people/joseph-bennett/). I am also a part-time Contract Biostatistician at Environment and Climate Change Canada, developing statistical offsets to account for biases in bird detectability during on- and off-road point count bird surveys.

In 2020, I completed my **BSc in Mathematical Science** in the *Statistics* stream, with an emphasis in Computer Science at the [University of Guelph](https://www.uoguelph.ca/). My honours thesis, supervised by [Dr Daniel Gillis](https://danielgillis.wordpress.com/), compared typologies of the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) within the context of generalized spatial Poisson mixture models. 

Throughout my undergraduate career, I worked as an Undergraduate Research Assistant under the supervision of Dr Gillis and [Dr. Shoshanah Jacobs](https://www.uoguelph.ca/ib/jacobs). I developed the Great Lakes Piping Plover Biological Modeling Program, which seeks to create [tools](https://github.com/BrandonEdwards/melodus) to assist in management and recovery of Great Lakes piping plovers (*Charadrius melodus circumcinctus*). You can read more about an 8-month co-op term [here](wt1.html).

I also completed a [4-month co-op term](wt3.html) working as a Bird Population Monitoring Analyst at Environment and Climate Change Canada in Summer 2018. In that position, I tested the use of generalized additive mixed-models for improving status and trend estimates of North American breeding birds, and developed the R package [bbsBayes](software.html#bbsBayes).

## Amateur Naturalist

When I'm not cranking out R code, I am exploring the world around me. My main passion lies in ornithology, and my free time is often spent birding. I contribute as much of my birding as I can to citizen science; you can find my eBird profile [here](https://ebird.org/profile/NjA1NTU0/CA-ON) (you may need an eBird account)! Birding with people of many other interests has allowed me to expand my own interests into the world of herps, moths, odes, and wildflowers. 

While statistics and computer science will be at the forefront of my academic research, I hope to also be able to contribute to natural history research through my amateur field observations.
