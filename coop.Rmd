title: "Co-operative Education"
---

While attending the University of Guelph, I have had the priviledge of partaking in co-operative education. My overall goal of my co-op experiences was to be as interdisciplinary as possible while gaining out-of-the-classroom computer science knowledge. Computer science is a very versatile field that has applications in almost any other field, and I wanted to tap into some of those applications.

Below, you will find work reports from my completed co-op job experiences at the University of Guelph.

      My first two work terms took place at the University of Guelph's School of Computer Science. I took on the role of an Undergraduate Research Assistant under the direction of Dr. Daniel Gillis.
