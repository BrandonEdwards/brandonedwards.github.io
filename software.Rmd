[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BrandonEdwards/bbsBayes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BrandonEdwards/bbsBayes)
[![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/bbsBayes)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bbsBayes)
[![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-maturing-blue.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#maturing)

Perform hierarchical Bayesian analysis of North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data. 'bbsBayes' will run a full model analysis for one or more species that you choose, or you can take more control and specify how the data should be stratified, prepared for JAGS, or modelled.

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/90767223.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/90767223)

Python implementation of an environment agent-based model. Simulate nesting and migrating Piping Plovers (*Charadrius melodus*) in the Great Lakes region.

## FishEBM.jl
[https://github.com/BrandonEdwards/FishEBM.jl](https://github.com/BrandonEdwards/FishEBM.jl)

Julia package containing functions to simulate the life cycle dynamics of managed fisheries. A fish population is divided into two components: adults and pre-recruits. Adults have age-specific survivorship, are harvested with age specific catchability, and spawn with age specific sexual maturity and fecundity. Agents graduate between several life stages, move, and face multiple forms of stage and location specific mortality. The model is a detailed and computationally intensive agent based model that does not track each individual agent, instead the environment is monitored while agents move throughout the chosen environment. This simulation tool is well suited for investigation of spatial risks in managed populations, where population level impacts may only be observable through changes in harvest.
